CRUD operation - used to manipulate records inside our database

Create - stores records in our database

INSERT INTO <tablename> (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3)

value1 will be the value for the column1
value2 will be the value for the column2
valueNth will be the value for the columnNth

ex. 
INSERT INTO artists (name) VALUES ("Taylor Swift");
INSERT INTO artists (name) VALUES ("Paramore");
INSERT INTO artists (name) VALUES ("Ed Sheeran");



Retrieve - retrieves records in our database

SELECT <columns> FROM <tablename>;

ex.
SELECT * FROM artists;
SELECT name FROM artists;

to select specific record/records we use the WHERE clause.
WHERE clause will filter the rows and returns it.

ex.
SELECT name FROM artists WHERE name = "Taylor Swift";


Update - updates, make changes on our records in our database.

UPDATE <tablename> SET column1 = updatedvalue, column2 = updatedvalue WHERE column3 = val3;

updatedvalue1 will be the new value of column1
updatedvalue2 will be the new value of column2
column3 = val3 describes the row to be updated

ex. UPDATE artists SET name = "Taylor Lautner" WHERE name = "Taylor Swift";

Delete - removes/deletes the record in our database

DELETE FROM <tablename> WHERE column = value;

column = value describes the row to be updated

ex. DELETE FROM artists WHERE name = "Taylor Swift";

*NOTE: Removing the WHERE clause will DELETE ALL THE ROWS on your table.


AND / OR Clause - we put these after the WHERE clause

AND - both of the conditions
OR - either of the conditions

ex.
SELECT * FROM songs WHERE length > 240 AND genre = "OPM";


LIKE Clause - to search for specified pattern in a column. We put this after the WHERE Clause

wildcard = % - the percent sign represents one or multiple characters

	columnname LIKE 'riot%' - finds any values starts with 'riot'
	columnname LIKE '%riot' - finds any values ends with 'riot'
	columnname LIKE '%riot%' - finds any values that have 'riot' in any position
	columnname LIKE 'the%apple' - finds any values that starts with 'the' and ends with 'apple'

SELECT * FROM albums WHERE artist_id = 3 AND album_name LIKE "%Riot!%"
